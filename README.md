Now that baseball itâ€™s all over and we can take a break on spending too much time through the season, I wanted to contribute to the baseball community. I am currently working as data scientist consultant in Accenture and since I am not a reporter or involve in media, I do not have much time to work on projects related with baseball. Hence, I took some of my free time to start working on a project.
